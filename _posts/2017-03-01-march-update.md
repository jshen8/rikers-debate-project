March was an exciting month for RDP, as we hosted our second public debate on President Trumpâ€™s immigration policies. The debate was held between two students from our female-only class at the Rose M. Singer Center and two students from our male-only classs George R. Vierno Center. The students went head to head debating the validity and ethics of the executive orders issues on immigration.

Special guest Samantha Bee helped judge, filming the debate for a segment on her show. Both teams were impressive as they discussed the intricacies and implications of the ban, but in the end the students from Rose M. Singer won the debate with their argument against the executive orders.
