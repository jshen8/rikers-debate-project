## Executive Director's Announcements

*Upcoming Fundraiser:* We have started preparation for our next fundraiser event, to support our Fellowship Program. We expect it to take place in late May or early June and are hoping to host it at Davis Polk.

## Zellnor Myrie Candidate Forum

On February 26th, the Rikers Debate Project held its first candidate forum, with Zellnor Myrie, a young lawyer who is running for State Senate in a district including parts of Crown Heights, Prospect Heights, Park Slope, and Sunset Park in Brooklyn. Mr. Myrie is challenging Senator Jesse Hamilton, who belongs to the IDC, a group of Democrats who vote with the Republicans in the New York State Senate. This has provoked much controversy, and Mr Myrie is running against Senator Hamilton to throw the Republicans out of power and create a unified Democratic majority.

> I was the moderator for the Zellnor Myrie town hall on the 26th. We presented Mr. Myrie with an assortment of questions on both criminal justice and housing related issues among others. His answers were genuine and articulate. He was personable and thoughtful in his responses. Although it was a small venue and audience, he gave us his full attention. He took every question, and helped us all understand complicated issues like the Independent Democratic Caucus, tenant and housing laws, and immigrant representation. I look forward to hearing from Senator Jesse Hamilton for a future event like this.”

## Class Updates

**EMTC (March 2):** Unfortunately class was cancelled on February 23rd due to an event in the class space. Last Friday the students had a fascinating and passionate discussion about Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. We began by discussing “power mapping,” the process of selecting goals, targets, and tactics to create social change. Students then debated which leader was more effective, addressing challenging questions including whether violence can be an appropriate tactic and what the role of white people should be in racial justice movements. Volunteers then taught a lesson about cross-examination, which involves attacking an opponent’s arguments by asking questions rather than making statements. The class tied it all together with one student giving an eloquent speech in favor of Malcolm X, and other students grilling him.

**GRVC (March 3):** On Saturday at GRVC, Ann, Alex, and Josh taught a case about whether government employees should be required to pay fees to public employee unions. Despite only even-numbered housing units being escorted to class (for reasons that seemed unclear), attendance was strong— with ten students including one of our captains, Terrell, and aspiring captain Ramon, who brought five students with him. The debate lesson of the day was on evidence, and Ann led an exercise where the class reviewed select paragraphs to dig into how the authors used evidence to prove their case. In our debate at the end of class Ramon, Roberto, and Thomas were on gov (anti-union) and Alex G. and Luis were opp (pro-union). We thank Officer Polidor -- a public sector union member himself -- for contributing to the debate.

**Rosie (March 3):** Class at Rosie this week was shorter and smaller than expected due to a conflicting concert / "feast" that a majority of the regular class attended instead. However, our group of five volunteers and three students participated in a spirited discussion and informal debate round on the recent Supreme Court decision that detained immigrants do not need to be given periodic bail hearings. While the decision was difficult to support, we were able to push ourselves and the students to understand why such a decision might be made, and in turn to better understand the portion of our country that believes we should limit immigrant rights. We are excited to teach "Debate Basics" in next week's class with a hopefully much larger group!

**VCBC (Spanish Class) (March 3):** this was our second week in a row of trying out the earlier class time (9am-11am, as opposed to our original slot of 1230pm-230pm). The first week of the earlier time we had 8 students; this past week we had 5. It seems that this is a more popular time with the students as it doesn’t conflict with weekly religious services at VCBC, but it’s still early on in the trial so we will see. This past week we covered the topic of universal basic income, which we thematically tied to the previous week’s topic of tests (drug tests/employment seeking) for recipients of welfare. Lots of spirited discussion even with a relatively small group. 

**Orientation (February 22):** Our February 25th orientation class welcomed five new volunteers to the RDP family. Class was taught by Pat Andriola and Josh Morrison, and the new volunteers heard about the history of RDP, what we do, how they can get involved, and the amazing growth our students have shown. The volunteers all signed up to attend classes, and others have already volunteered to assist with non-teaching work. The next orientation will be April 1st at 12pm at Davis Polk, hosted by Lexie Filkins. People can reach out to [Pat Andriola](patrickandriola@gmail.com) and/or [Lexie Filkins](lexiefilkins@gmail.com) if they're interested in attending an orientation.

## Reentry Update

The Rikers Debate Project is working hard to fully roll out our reentry program this year. Our biggest challenge has been finding a new co-host for our reentry class. We have reached out to Friends of Island Academy and the Osborne Association, and we would be grateful for any suggestions or connections you have! In addition, we have two volunteers, Lexie and Tripp, preparing the second issue of the newsletter, which we expect to release in March. We also have five teams of volunteers working to help former student prepare for upcoming parole hearings. Assistance with parole preparation increases the chance of success from 1 in 5 to 1 in 2, so we are excited about this new initiative. Other components of our reentry work will include a fellowship program, mentoring, and empowering involvement in activism. If you have any questions or ideas, or if you would like to get involved in our reentry program, please email [Caitlin Halpern](caitlin.halpern@gmail.com).

## Expansion Update

*Boston:* We have submitted a proposal to Suffolk County House of Correction through our local volunteer, Sam Hocking. The facility is reviewing, but personnel there are optimistic about a class starting sometime this spring.

*New Haven:* RDP volunteer Ann Manov met with staff at York Correctional Institute, a women's facility, in a very productive meeting and we expect to start a class there very soon. Stay tuned for a Connecticut Class Launch Solidarity Fundraiser on behalf of the Connecticut Bail Fund! Contact [Ann Manov](ann.manov@yale.edu) if you want to get involved with the fundraiser or the impending Connecticut class.

*New Orleans:* A NYC volunteer who has moved to New Orleans, Leland Whitehouse, is beginning to reach out to facilities in hopes of starting a class.

*Washington D.C.:* Our first and only class outside of New York is still going strong! Email Kat Hyland or David Yin for more information.

If you'd like to get involved in any of these initiatives (or know anyone who would), please reach out to [Pat Andriola]( patrick.andriola@gmail.com)
