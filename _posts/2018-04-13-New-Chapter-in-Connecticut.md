The Rikers Debate Project is proud to announce the founding of the **York Debate Society,** a new debate club formed at York Correctional Institution in Niantic, CT.

Classes are Saturdays from 8-11am. The chapter holds weekly meetings on Tuesday nights at 8pm in New Haven, Connecticut.

The new chapter was organized by RDP volunteer [Ann Manov](mailto:ann.manov@yale.edu) and board member [Alex Taubes](mailto:alextt@gmail.com). The first class was Saturday, April 7, 2018, on the topic *Resolved: we prefer a world where people cannot lie.*
