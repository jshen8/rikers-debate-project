The Rikers Debate Project is proud to publish the second issue of the RDP Newsletter. You can download the Newsletter at this link: [RDP Newsletter Issue 2](http://www.rikersdebateproject.org/RDPNewsletter2.pdf)

This RDP newsletter will soon be sent to nearly 200 current and former students at Rikers Island and other correctional facilities across the state. In addition to updates about our classes and events, the newsletter features impressive student writing and artwork.

If you're interested in getting involved with the RDP Newsletter or any of RDP's other activities in the area of Reentry, get in touch with [Caitlin Halpern](mailto:caitlinhalpern@gmail.com)!
