## How can you get involved? 

Rikers Debate Project is always looking for volunteers! Whether you want to teach class with us on weekends, join one of our work groups, or both, there is a place for you on our team!

 Please read the work group document below or 
[linked here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14_rATuPsSx7pn2vuPx-eWg_qZzM4IUTnLUERU8GVx68/edit?usp=sharing) to understand the different work groups you can join. Then indicate your interests in the form below, and someone from our team will reach out to you. 

If you are only interested in teaching class and not joining a work group, we ask that you indicate an interest area anyway. You DO NOT have to join a group if you want to teach class, or vice versa!
