## How can you get involved? Tiers of Engagement:

The RDP Personnel Management team uses a unique volunteer management model to
personalize the experience of any interested individual who wants to get involved with
us. Each person has a one on one conversation with a personnel manager to
understand the individualâ€™s interests, capacity, time constraints, and broader skills-
development goals. The manager then works to match each individual to one or more
RDP workgroups and checks in regularly to ensure they are engaged in the activities
that interest them most. Some rough categories of engagement, in order of lightest
touch to heavy involvement:

1. **Join a virtual workgroup** (0-3 hrs/week): Ranging from a social media and
communications team that gets the word out about us, to an impact analysis
group that studies data from our classes and a curriculum development group
that writes lesson plans for future classes, a virtual work group is a great way to
work on a discrete area for RDP with a team. There are leaders who will hold
conference calls/skype sessions when needed, and communicate with the team
via email in between on any ongoing projects.

2. **Teach or assist teachers with class** (5 hrs per class): Come join one of our
classes on Rikers Island and serve as an assistant teacher or lead teacher. New
volunteers are encouraged to teach regularly (ideally once a month), though we
also have members who teach less frequently because of the time commitment
getting onto the island. You will help pick the debate topic, create activities for
class, and work with our students one on one.

3. **Lead a virtual workgroup** (2-5 hrs/week): Want to help us write a prison reform
bill that we can introduce in Albany? Interested in developing a reintegration
program so that our students who leave Rikers are still connected to debate as
they re-enter society? Have some other great idea of something RDP can be
doing? Start a workgroup using our pool of existing volunteers and make it
happen!

4. **Become a facility director** (5-7 hrs/week): If you love teaching a one particular
facility, become a co-director and help plan all our classes and programming for
those students!
