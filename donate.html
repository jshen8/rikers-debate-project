    <p> Rikers Debate Project is constantly working to expand the services we can provide to our students. While we’ve started with supporting them during their time at Rikers, we’re working to make sure that we’re able to be there for them holistically - whether that’s as they serve their sentence, or upon release.

Wherever they are, we are committed to finding the best ways to advocate for our students, amplifying their voices and helping in the fight for their rights and justice. We would love your help as we work towards this. </p>
